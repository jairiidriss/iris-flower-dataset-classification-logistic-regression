<h1>Iris Flower Classification using Logistic Regression and Decision BoundaryÂ Plotting</h1>
<p>
In this new repository, I explained how to solve a classification problem using the scikit-learn library and the logistic regression algorithm. By Building a machine learning model to distinguish between three categories( or classes) of the Iris flower (Multi-class classification).

<p>
I also explained how to build decision boundaries for binary and multiclass classification tasks
